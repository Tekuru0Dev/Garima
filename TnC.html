        <h2>1. Accepting These Terms</h2>
        <p><strong>This document and the other documents that we reference below make up our house rules, or what we officially call our Terms of Use (the “Terms” for short).</strong></p>
        <p>The Terms are a legally binding contract between you and <u>Artisanal</u>. If you live in North America or South America, the contract is between you and Artisanal, Inc.; if you live elsewhere, the contract is between you and Artisanal Ireland UC, a subsidiary of Artisanal, Inc. We’ll just refer to Artisanal, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries collectively as “Artisanal”.</p>
        <p><strong> Pleasenote that Section 11. Disputes with Artisanal, contains an arbitration clause and class action waiver. By agreeing to the Terms, you agree to resolve all disputes through binding individual arbitration, which means that you waive any right to have those disputes decided by a judge or jury, and that you waive your right to participate in class actions, class arbitrations, or representative actions. * </strong></p>
        <p>This contract sets out your rights and responsibilities when you use Artisanal.com, Pattern by Artisanal, our mobile apps, and the other services provided by Artisanal (we’ll refer to all of these collectively as our “Services”), so please read it carefully. By using any of our Services (even just browsing one of our websites), you’re agreeing to the Terms. If you don’t agree with the Terms, you may not use our Services. Agree with us? Great, read on!</p>

        <h2>2. Those Other Documents We Mentioned</h2>
        <p>Artisanal’s Services connect people around the world, both online and offline, to make, sell, and buy unique goods. Here’s a handy guide to help you understand the specific rules that are relevant for you, depending on how you use the Services:</p>
        <ul>
         <li><p><strong>Our House Rules for Everyone.</strong> If you use any of our Services, you agree to these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and our Anti-Discrimination Policy.</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Our House Rules for Sellers.</strong> If you list any items for sale through our Services, these policies apply to you. You can read them here.</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Our House Rules for Buyers.</strong> If you use our Services to browse or shop, these policies apply to you. You can read them here.</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Our House Rules for Third Parties.</strong> These policies apply to intellectual property owners, Artisanal API users, affiliates, and anyone requesting information from Artisanal.</p></li>
         <li><p><strong>Search and Advertising Ranking Disclosures.</strong> This is a concise summary of how Artisanal organises search results and advertising results that could include Your Content.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of these policies are a part of our Terms, so be sure to read the ones that are relevant for you. Of course, you’ll still want to read the rest of this document because it applies to everyone!</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>3.Your Privacy</h2>
        <p>We know your personal information is important to you, so it’s important to us. <u>Our Privacy Policy</u> details how your information is collected, used and shared when you use our Services. By using our Services, you're also agreeing that we can process your information in the ways set out in the Privacy Policy, so please read it here.</p>
        <p>Both Artisanal and sellers process members’ personal information (for example, buyer name, email address, and delivery address) and are therefore considered separate and independent data controllers of buyers’ personal information under EU law. That means that each party is responsible for the personal information it processes in providing the Services. For example, if a seller accidentally discloses a buyer’s name and email address when fulfilling another buyer’s order, the seller, not Artisanal, will be responsible for that unauthorised disclosure.  </p>
        <p>If, however, Artisanal and sellers are found to be joint data controllers of buyers’ personal information, and if Artisanal is sued, fined, or otherwise incurs expenses because of something that you did as a joint data controller of buyer personal information, you agree to indemnify Artisanal for the expenses it occurs in connection with your processing of buyer personal information. See Section 9. Indemnification (or What Happens If You Get Us Sued) below for more information about your indemnification obligations to Artisanal.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>4.Your Content</h2>
        <p>Content that you post using our Services is your content (so let’s refer to it as “Your Content”). We don’t make any claim to it, which includes anything you post using our Services (like shop names, profile pictures, listing photos, listing descriptions, reviews, comments, videos, usernames, etc.).</p>
        <p><strong>A. Responsibility for Your Content.</strong> You understand that you are solely responsible for Your Content. You represent that you have all necessary rights to all parts of Your Content and that you’re not infringing or violating any third party’s rights by posting it.</p>
        <p><strong>B. Permission to Use Your Content.</strong> By posting Your Content through our Services, you grant Artisanal a license to use it. We don’t claim any ownership to Your Content, but we have your permission to use it to help Artisanal function and grow. That way, we won’t infringe any rights you have in Your Content and we can help promote it. For example, you acknowledge and agree Artisanal may offer you or Artisanal buyers promotions on the Site, from time to time, that may relate to your listings</p>
        <p><strong>C. Rights You Grant Artisanal.</strong> (Here’s the legalese version of the last section). By posting Your Content, you grant Artisanal a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use, display, edit, modify, reproduce, distribute, store, and prepare derivative works of Your Content. This allows us to provide the Services and to promote Artisanal, your Artisanal shop, or the Services in general, in any formats and through any channels, including across any Artisanal Services, our partners, or third-party website or advertising medium. You agree not to assert any moral rights or rights of publicity against us for using Your Content. You also recognise our legitimate interest in using it, in accordance with the scope of this license, to the extent Your Content contains any personal information.</p>
        <p><strong>D. Reporting Unauthorised Content.</strong> Artisanal has great respect for intellectual property rights, and is committed to following appropriate legal procedures to remove infringing content from the Services. If content that you own or have rights to has been posted to the Services without your permission and you want it removed, please follow the steps listed in our Intellectual Property Policy. If Your Content is alleged to infringe another person’s intellectual property, we will take appropriate action, such as disabling it if we receive a report of infringement that complies with our policies, or terminating your account if you are found to be a repeat infringer. We’ll notify you if any of that happens.</p>
        <p><strong>E. Inappropriate, False, or Misleading Content.</strong> This should be common sense, but there are certain types of content we don’t want posted on Artisanal’s Services (for legal reasons or otherwise). You agree that you will not post any content that is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, or otherwise offensive or in violation of our Prohibited Items Policy, Community Policy, or any part of our Terms. You also agree not to post any content that is false and misleading or uses the Services in a manner that is fraudulent or deceptive.</p>

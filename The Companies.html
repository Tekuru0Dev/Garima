        <p>BYHAND believe in “Traditional Wear in a Contemporary Style”.  We have started a movement that helps promote a socially conscious lifestyle. All our apparel is refreshingly simply and celebrates Indian Craft. Every woman defines herself through her own personal style. BYHAND is for people who are conscious about the choices they make.  Our products are all designed with the idea to make the wearer proud and to feel good about themselves. This feel-good-factor comes from knowing that BYHAND is on a mission to enable sustainable livelihoods for artisans by eliminating the middleman.</p>

        <h3><a class="footer-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.dmodot.com/pages/home">DmoDot</a></h3>
        <p>The dot is life itself, and dmodot hatched from the dot -- its ever evolving nature, its permanence. Founded in 2014, dmodot (read as d-m-o-dot) was earlier Dameriino and birthed from our love of handcrafted leather footwear. Like the dot, the brand has evolved to ease in subtlety with style. Like the dot, the simplicity of the dmodot shoe stands out. It’s alive, never distracting.
          At dmodot, we truly care about each and every pair of handmade shoe and our customers who choose to buy them. We know that great quality will make you happy, and we take pride in the high quality of our material, construction, and comfort.</p>
